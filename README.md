# genericQtGLBullet
Here is a first pass at a multi-platform project that could build on Mac, Linux, and Windows that includes OpenGL with Qt5, GLSL, Qt UI built in Creator, and physics simulation via Bullet.

See the CMakeLists.txt file for more information.

I've placed this here primarily for a project template. Others are welcome to use it if helpful (although I likely cannot offer any support).
